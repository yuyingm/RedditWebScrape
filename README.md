# RedditWebScrape
A test repository for a DA Portfolio project in scraping Reddit ethically / legally using Python, &amp; JSON

Date Started:
7 Nov, 2023

Project Outline:
I'd like to create a DA Portfolio piece where I scrape data from reddit to answer a research question.
Probably, this research question will be related to inflation and cost of living from the r/sydney sub-reddit, where I am from.
However, baby steps first and I'd like to just be able to work through:
- python
- json

And then perform some analytics on it to change the numbers / what I find into actual informative knowledge using perhaps Tableau or some kind of data visualisation tools.

I'd also like this to be a proof of use of GitHub, just to practice using it!

Timeframe:
I'd like to give myself a 2-3 month timeframe.
